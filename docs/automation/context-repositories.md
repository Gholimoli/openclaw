# Context repositories

Coding agents fail most often when project context is missing, stale, or buried in long diffs and logs. A context repository (or a `context/` folder inside your repo) is a small, versioned set of files that stays stable across coding sessions.

This improves:

- correctness (fewer wrong assumptions)
- speed (less re-derivation)
- token usage (smaller prompts)
- security (clear boundaries and non-goals)

## Two layouts

Pick one:

1. In-repo context folder: keep a `context/` directory in your code repo.
2. Separate context repo: keep context in a dedicated repo and sync it into the coding environment when needed.

The in-repo approach is simplest and works well with PR review.

## Recommended structure

Create a `context/` folder with small, curated files:

- `context/PROJECT.md`
  - what this is, who it is for, goals and non-goals
- `context/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - high-level module map, data flow, and trust boundaries
- `context/DECISIONS.md`
  - brief ADR-style decisions (what, why, when)
- `context/RUNBOOK.md`
  - dev, test, release commands and common failure fixes
- `context/CONSTRAINTS.md`
  - security requirements, cost limits, API rate limits, compliance rules

Optional generated artifacts (pipeline owned):

- `context/CHANGELOG_SUMMARY.md`
  - short summary of recent PRs and key changes, regenerated by automation

## How to use this with /work

Recommended patterns:

- Make your `/work task ...` descriptions reference `context/` files instead of pasting long histories into chat.
- Keep "guardrails" in `context/CONSTRAINTS.md` (for example: do not store secrets, do not add network calls, do not change auth behavior).
- When a PR is opened, include a short summary that links to the relevant `context/` sections.

This pairs well with the bounded review loop described in [Coding automation pipeline](/automation/coding-pipeline).

## What not to put in context

- secrets or tokens
- personal data
- long raw logs (summarize them instead)
- duplicated code (link to files and symbols instead)
